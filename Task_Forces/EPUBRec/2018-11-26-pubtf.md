### 1. Influence of non-WG members on WG work
{: #section1}

**Ivan Herman:** situation is not specific to this wg, decision power for features is by the members of the wg  
… there is a practice of people from outside wg giving opinions through mailist or github  
… if you go to the director for approval and there are open technical issues, there is a problem regardless of who opened that issue  
… if there are people outside the wg who have strong opinions that they raise, this is taken into account  
… wg makes decisions, but expect that chairs are careful to take into account any opinions raised  
… same for test suite items and epub tests, grateful for tests from outside  
… non-w3c members can raise issues and it must be taken into account  

**Dave Cramer:** the same is true for the CSS WG  
… there are people who are heard and opinions valued from people who know what they are talking about  

**Luc Audrain:** agree with ivan and dave that issues are taken seriously  
… point that publishers will not be inside the voting process  
… want the publishers and the bg and cg to be aware of this  
… possible to make objections and issues, but this requires that they have people skilled enough and aware enough to make an objection  
… makes the epub3 REC goes away from the publishing industry  
… idpf was a publishing industry community and the membership was affordable, which is not the case with w3c  
… epub3 standard will be taken away, not far away, but away  

**Tzviya Siegman:** recognize the concern, but can look at it as an issue for how we explain membership  
… the membership costs are high, but we have effectively the same group of people who are involved now  
… in principle it seems a problem, in practice maybe not an issue  
… it may be the way we explain it and we can help people and where they can be involved  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** hear all of you, but think we need a little faith and it is a matter of communication  

**Dave Cramer:** tracked names and people who commented (like 60%) are people who are members  
… the majority of people would not be locked out by this  

**Luc Audrain:** asks if this would change after the TPI  

**Dave Cramer::** not sure how much that would change  

**Wendy Reid:** sounds more like a communication than participation issue  
… if what we need to do is maintain incredibly clear lines of communication, we can do things about that  
… this shouldn't be a huge hurdle  

**Ivan Herman:** probably possible to add explicitly to the charter that we are mindful to the public and put in some language that makes it easier  

**Luc Audrain:** this brings new load on the rechartering  
… it brings issues about communications between the groups  
… agree we can improve communication to address the concern  
… bg should have more focused calls and people understand what is at stake and give opinion  
… not optimistic that all the experts we need will be there after the TPI, germany and norway are not here  
… we should clarify with w3cm what will be the future after end of january  

**Tzviya Siegman:** don't think we have all the experts we need  
… this has always been a problem, there is always a small group of contributors  
… more participation would be wonderful  

**Luc Audrain:** puts more responsibility on members like Hachette and others  
… associations in close contact with publishers in other areas may help with communications  
… have people in the wg and the bg and associations involved also  

### 2. what we think are the benefit of rec track?
{: #section2}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** makes the spec/ISO work easier  

> *Wendy Reid:* +1

**Tzviya Siegman:** best benefit is to go through the testing process and that will help us find bugs that we've never found  
… epubtest.org and efforts have been helpful and this will be better and will get a lot of eyes on the spec  
… that will help with interest from the web community  

**Luc Audrain:** not so optimistic, the tests in the CG will be good and bugs good  
… that testing is good decision toward rec track, would be useful even if no rec  
… web community to have a look, not sure that is interesting to them web community because of non-w3c standards  
… we have concerns it would be modified with rec track  
… should not impact our industry because we are using it today  
… anxious for something happening to the spec  
… not sure that ISO and Japanese community need this  

**Dave Cramer:** there is a fundamental question of do we think epub is good enough or not  
… struggled for a long time, foundational difficulties with interoperability  
… used this approach for a long time now and not making progress with problems with the epub ecosystem  
… don't think there is a fundamental issue for rec, but the process will help us make it more robust  
… don't see other choices that will get us where we need to be  
… this is one of the few tools we have available  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1 dauwhe

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** need to think about japanese govt needs and publisher needs separately  

**Dave Cramer:** think we need to think about what does the publishing world need  

**Tzviya Siegman:** think we should go rec track and not get too tied up in ISO  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** ivan- please clarify if ISO requires rewriting or is basically a rubber stamp if we are rec track  

**Ivan Herman:** yes, it is a rubber stamp  

**Luc Audrain:** asks tzviya about commitment to this community  

**Tzviya Siegman:** at TPAC the wg was more focused on epub than wp  
… the wp may suite for audiobooks, but we need to think about what does the publishing world need  
… what do we need to focus on that the publishing community will adopt  
… what will make epub 3.2 be something adopted?  
… rec track will make it happen more easily  

**Ivan Herman:** it is true for the time being that epub 3.2 staying in the cg will not really have attention from the w3c as is true of hundreds of cgs  
… wg is finding it's role and don't really understand what to do and where we want to go  
… if 3.2 comes into w3c with all the problems it becomes more the rest of the business community will use it and not forget  
… makes more tangible that there is a community that uses w3c technologies and their feedback needs to be taken more seriously  
… if there a whole community that is part of the w3c the many things that are limited they will more likely be addressed  
… it makes publishing part of the core work, and it is a bit of psychology  

**Dave Cramer:** we need help from the larger web community to bring publishing closer to the web  
… epub has a complicated relationship with the web  
… don't think we have shown we can play well with the web  
… need to be mindful of relationships  

**Luc Audrain:** have urgent need for audiobook  
… never identified epub 3.2 as a rec for an urgent need  
… show epub 3.2 that we are involved, but we know it is not pure web  
… epub 3.2 is epub 3.0.1  
… psychology interest is to have stable environment  
… can produce epub and have epubcheck  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** agree with ivan and tzviya on psychology and with luc on priorities with audiopub  
… can do both at once  

**Ivan Herman:** psychology with web community  
… epub now has a peculiar position that it is the largest implementation of css and svg and core tech outside of browsers  
… no other deployments are as wide with cars and payments and others  
… the community helps clarify that web tech is not just for web browsers  
… have major usage outside the web browser world  
… if we are in w3c and we do the work, it will be an aha feeling  
… w3c is part of deployment, that counts  

**Tzviya Siegman:** we're not getting far writing the doc  
… ab meeting at the end of Jan. and wants the pub community to meet
