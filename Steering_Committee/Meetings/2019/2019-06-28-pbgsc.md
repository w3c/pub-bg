**Rachel Comerford:** discussions about the future of WP spec and audiobook spec  

**Dave Cramer:** serious concerns about the current state of the WP spec  
… publishers not to implement it soon  
… no clear business case  
… content creator not eager to create a new format  
… nothing we can do in existing format  
… dissatisfaction in the WG this year  
… proposal to suspend work on WP as no clear business need  
… focus on audio spec as business case  
… people willing to implement  
… pickup on WP later based on broader participation and clearer business calls  
… and discussion on the future of EPUB itself  
… EPUB 3.x track and more  
… focus on areas where we have business needs  

**Bill Kasdorf:** surprised on disappointed  
… chicken and egg problem here  
… not more publishers around the table  
… EPUB3..2 is a good thing for the Pub industry  
… one problem is people continue to have a need in browsers  
… OECD publish Web Book  
… complex document more than individual Web site  
… they make EPUB but they are not sufficient  
…   
… I would hate that he concept of a complex pub in browser being abandoned  
… There is a barrier today for an EPUB working on the Web  
… Web participation missing  
… Scholarly publishing are publishing article in Web sites  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/urban-rural-and-regional-development/applying-the-oecd-principles-on-water-governance-to-floods_d5098392-en#page7](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/urban-rural-and-regional-development/applying-the-oecd-principles-on-water-governance-to-floods_d5098392-en#page7)

**Wendy Reid:** emphasized that we are not killing WP  
… publish as a note : it is here  
… other group may take it BDComa, Pub CG  
… Pub trade industry may be interested later  
… make it even more open to any group interested, like non profit org  
… problem we are now recieving feedback  
… major publisher already say they would not use WP  
… at DPub summit , the future of EPUB is still bright  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1 that we're not at the point of needing to replace EPUB

**Wendy Reid:** at least for couple of years  

**Rachel Comerford:** for us as a member, audiobook is a big draw  
… decrease membership in the W3C changes the way we as a company would be interested in W3C  
… focus on audiobook and what happen to EPUB4  

**Wendy Reid:** looking at the option of asking the industry about the future of EPUB  
… the WG would not recharter as a WG  
… we need to legitimizing EPUB as a REC track  

**Jeff Jaffe:** 2 questions  
… one about the WG  
… Wg are best when they focus on business need and implementer behind  
… positive on the change of direction  
… overall groups at W3C, we recognize they is a lot of shifting before we work on the proper consensus  
… nothing going on to a place with a broad point of view  
… what the roadmap is  
… seq art: refining on WP  
… where is that taking place  
… we need a strong initiative outside the WG to a vision for the next years  

**George Kerscher:** pub on th e web today is horrible, PDF doc  
… there isn’t an existing pub standard to replace PDF  
… more and more epeople using mobile phone, opportunity to define a spec  
… business case for commercial publisher may not be there  
… I see different profile to support manga and other area not in EPUB be very good  
… moving EPUB3 forward to embrace pub activities  

**Dave Cramer:** to George, less PDF on the web, but every system allow to create PDF pushing a button  
… EPUB was a possible replacement for PDF but didn’t happen  
… HTML building things in the Web platform would work better  
… building indvidual features in the platform rather a new format  
… require a lot of work and effort and money to bring compelling business use cases, new revenues, no answer to that question  

**Bill Kasdorf:** OECD need something else than EPUB  
… instead of standard going more complex, they get to profile  
… see ODRL  
… on REC track, it went more simple as framexwork and profiles  
… are we not close enough that WP give a framework for manga cases  
… the standard should not try to everything for everybody  
… i do agree that for books, just continuing EPUB3 is the way to go  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** this is the right move right now  
… agree that we don’t want to give up the dream  
… a way forward to focus on audiobook  
… make audiobook spreadsheet to nav doc  
… good opportunity from the Japanese issue on validation  
… alternative on navigation  
… spine order but also on another way : another generation of EPUB  
… good stepping stone on the way to where we have to go  
… in PBG we have struggle to involve people to engage in W3C community  

**Ivan Herman:** to George love your understatement on PDF  
… Web Pub is the extreme, fully part of the web, may raise issues  
… Version of EPUB can be presented in a browser, a viewer can work very well with a11y features  
… looking at how PEUB could evolve with incremental steps  
… the idea EPUB evolve and have that done in the right way  
… what would happen with the dreams  
… several CG going alive  
… parallels action: we do a WG, we would revive the DPug IG with a ne setup  
… with more specific goals than we have in the CG  
… security, resource from all over the web  
… difficult to sole with WPub  
… about the WP providing the minimal profile  
… this extremely general on the Web creates lots of issues  
… if the idea is to take the audiobook spec, probably what is there as a manifest may be reuse in other profile like for Manga  
… could be used as a common vocabulary  

**Wendy Reid:** to jeff, other thing we need to explore, bring new ideas  
… worth to have another workshop on the future of digital pub  
… keep it broad, and getting input from people like OECD  
… get more idea on other groups we need  

**George Kerscher:** work more closely with the HTML community, good idea from Dave  
… we need to make to know HTML as a publication format  
… and EPUB converging in the road  

**Luc Audrain:** the discussion is important  
… I don't think we should lose the dream, as Liisa says  
… these hopes for having in the future for having something more webby  
… we know the work of w3c for the publishing industry is important  
… we have more involvement and more openness for the industry to work with us  
… there is a major problem because of w3c fees  
… and digital income is only a small portion of their business  
… around 8% in France  
… it make take time. We have to figure out how to get the commitment of the industry  
… we had an idea with Wendy during the summit to have more community groups  
… to make the industry more aware  
… a publishing a11y community group, for example  
… to find help, to voice their concerns  
… to find a process for their publications  
… like Dave is asking in the CG, how to get community questions answered  
… we should not lose hope. standards take a long time.  
… if it means we should suspend, I still don't want us to lose hope  

**Bill Kasdorf:** rel  
… client seeing content in granular terms  
… client changing their focus as book as a web site  
… lot in education  
… granular and packaged in different ways  
… love the model of suspending  
… we realize that incubation needs to come before  
… with WP, here’s here we are, and with that go where you want  

**Jeff Jaffe:** W3C doesn’t care about revenue, CG for incubation is feature not a bug  
… as a SC, involve and driving the effort  

**Luc Audrain:** I was speaking to Avneesh, who is now on the AB  

> *Rachel Comerford:* laudrain: I spoke with avneesh at the dpub summit

**Luc Audrain:** I think he should be here in the SC  
… his vision and experience in strategy should be a good thing for us  

> *Liisa McCloy-Kelley:* +1 to Avneesh joining the SC

**Luc Audrain:** I think he has a role to play, not just for a11y but for everything  
… I think he should be a member of our group
