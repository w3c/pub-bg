## Agenda
### 9:00 - 9:10 Opening Reminders and Introduction

The outcome of the publishing strategy meetings is to come up with a
strategy for publishing at W3C for next 3 to 5 years. Strategy
development exercise is different from project planning, the two most
important foundation blocks of publishing strategy are:

-   Identification of target beneficiaries and compelling objectives for
    the beneficiaries

-   Shared ownership of objectives: The target beneficiaries should feel
    that these objectives are their own objectives.

With only 4 hours for this first call, we will focus on foundational
blocks and short term priorities on this call. The concrete decisions
will require greater involvement of stake holders and this first meeting
should be used to figure out how to involve them in the process.

### 9:10 - 9:20 Known Truths

Review the things we know and agree on:

-   We plan to continue to support and develop EPUB

-   We plan to continue to support the Validator/Validation for EPUB

-   The Working Group and Business Groups will continue to work,
    although their goals and objectives will continue to evolve

-   The ultimate objective of our work is to address the business needs
    of the publishing industry

-   We have a number of 'in development' documents -- wpub and audibook
    included -- whose future track needs to be determined

-   **NEW:** We will continue to support our readers and end users of
    all abilities and have a great reading experience for all users

### 9:20 - 10:00 Indentifying Target Beneficiaries

Are there any additional target beneficiaries that we would like to
identify that do not fall under the following categories?

1.  Entities in publishing industry that have their business model
    greatly dependent on EPUB 3

2.  Entities from EPUB 3 eco system which believe in the power of the
    web platform, and that more publishing can happen on the web.

3.  Entities that are using native web technologies like HTML and CSS
    for publishing on the web and intend to have some features from
    publications like maintaining editions, defining bounds of HTML
    pages etc.

4.  **Revised:** Entities that are publishing on the web without using
    W3C technologies (EPUB 3, HTML etc.) but could benefit from them

**NEW:** Ultimate Beneficiary: End user

### 12:00 -- 12:45 Longer term plan

The charters should reflect the work that the publishing industry
requires and supports. For this, important question is about involvement
of target beneficiaries:

-   Which of the above beneficiary groups are well involved in
    publishing at W3C and which are the groups which should be involved?

-   How to come up with concrete objectives for the beneficiary groups
    that are already involved while ensuring that they feel ownership on
    the objectives?

-   How to reach out to groups which are not properly involved in
    publishing at W3C and discover the compelling reasons that would get
    them involved?

-   What are we doing with the current works that we have in process?
