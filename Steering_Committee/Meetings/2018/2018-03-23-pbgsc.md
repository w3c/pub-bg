### 1. Outreach
{: #section1}

**Ivan Herman:** Should we blog more (e.g.,, EPUB 3.2)?  
… Likely can allow BG co-chairs to write W3C blogs too.  
… Community should know that CG is doing real work on EPUB.  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Statement of work & call for volunteers  

> ***Resolution #1: Dave & Rachel will do a blog post on EPUB 3.2 and Ivan will get it posted***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Does RFP makes sense for epbucheck work?  Yes, likely.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Adds transparency, which could be a good thing.  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** epubcheck RFP for short-term fix for 3.2, then overall, but not throw out and start over.  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Likely do a blog post re said RFP; different from Dave/Rachel one re 3.2 effort.  

> ***Resolution #2: Liisa & Karen to sync.***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** RFP process likely to be disclosed to full BG next week (after sync with BillM).  

**Garth Conboy:** the likes of OverDrive, Kobo, et al, should review the RFP from the perspective of “are we doing the right things?”  

### 2. IOS Standardization options
{: #section2}

> *Luc Audrain:* [https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/wiki/Five-options-for-creating-ISO-IEC-specifications](https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/wiki/Five-options-for-creating-ISO-IEC-specifications)

**Ivan Herman:** (for Makoto) From W3C standard (3.2) to ISO “fast track”  

**Tzviya Siegman:** e.g., re schema.org, need to not skew to far towards ISO style — be more 3.1-ish (IDPF/W3C) style.  

> *Dave Cramer:* The cart is driving the horse

**Garth Conboy:** From roadmap: “Preserve the new specification organization from EPUB 3.1 for EPUB 3.2.  
… Preserve the vocabularies (such as manifest properties vocabulary) introduced by EPUB 3.1.“  

**Luc Audrain:** Continue ISO discussion, as long as we don’t derail the current short-term CG EPUB 3.2 effort.  

**Bill Kasdorf:** BISG is leading a “get to 3.0.1 now effort — with 3.2 being backward compatible with that”. Maybe worth mentioning on next BG call.
