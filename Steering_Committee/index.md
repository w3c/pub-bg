# Steering Committee
{: .no_toc}

The Publishing BG chooses a Steering Committee to help coordinate and facilitate the work of the EPUB3 CG, Publishing BG, and WG. The steering committee has no independent authority; formal decision-making remains in the Publishing BG as a whole. The membership of the Steering Committee includes the chairs of all working groups, interest groups, and community groups associated with Publishing @W3C (provided those chairs are members of the Publishing BG), ex officio members that include the W3Câ€™s Publishing Champion, the W3C staff contacts for each group, and other members as chosen by the Business Group, up to a maximum of 16 members.

The SC has a meeting once every two weeks on Fridays. The [list of the meeting minutes](./Meetings/) is available on this site.
