> *Karen Myers:* Chairs: Daihei and Liisa

**Tzviya Siegman:** Some people are permanently on irc and he may not be on the call  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Let's start  
… this the Japan/Asia friendly time call  
… I am under the weather today  
… so I will only chair the first part of this and then Liisa will join later  
… and I will leave it to her  
… I trust you have received the agenda  
… Meeting times going forward  
… in US it will change to daylight savings time on 10 March  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** I just mentioned the meeting times; can you please continue?  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** sure  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** for meeting times we will continue the alternate weeks of North America/Europe and Asia/Japan  
… we are proposing that after daylight savings we change to 8:00pm EST, 5:00pm Pacific and 9:00am Japan  
… is that acceptable for everyone?  

**Junko Kamata:** This time, 9:00am is perfect for me  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** we will send out an email  
… I believe Garth has updated the invitation for the meeting for the new schedule we will keep for the next couple of months to see how this works  

**Garth Conboy:** I have not done the updates, but I can certainly do so  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** We will send out by email and one of chairs will send you request for the calendar  

**Garth Conboy:** and we are not changing the NA/Europe call, correct?  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** correct  
… any other questions or comments on that before moving on  

### 1. Event Calendar
{: #section1}

> *Liisa McCloy-Kelley:* [https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=NWhvMW05aTdsNHVzOXEzbWEyMGVlMmh2a2NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=NWhvMW05aTdsNHVzOXEzbWEyMGVlMmh2a2NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** We have started to publish a calendar and chairs of BG have started to put events in  
… There was a question last week on the North American and Europe call if we should include regional events  
… like country-specific events  
… Chairs discussed and we believe we should include any events that you feel will be helpful. We'll leave that open-ended  
… Luc wanted us to mention the EPUB Summit in June is coming up  
… that should be a good event for members of that community  
… Daihei, do you want to mention anything on the Japanese event before TPAC?  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** based on last discussion, I am asking if Sept 14-15 before TPAC in Fukuoka  
… I think it depends upon professors' schedules  
… I will let you know if I hear any progress  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Great  
… any questions about event calendar  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** ebookcraft is on the calendar; it will be a good event  

### 2. EPUB3.2
{: #section2}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** There has been discussion if we can get Publishing@W3C members to give us adoption testimonials  
… and collect those as people adopt them  
… think about whether you want to participate in that  

**Karen Myers:** there is support for EPUB3.2 testimonials from W3C communications perspective  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** EPUB3.2 beta is available and we recommend that you test it out and give feedback  
… there has been some discussion on GitHub  
… please do continue to raise any concerns  

**Bill Kasdorf:** Can you remind us what the additional testing is in this release  
… the EPUB4.2 Check I believe matches the EPUB3.2 spec  

**Garth Conboy:** It is not exact, but quite close  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* full release notes: [https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases)

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** my technical people said things that have been deprecated; warnings and errors are good things to check out  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I just put a link to the release notes in irc  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Thank you, Tzviya  
… and reminder that we are continuing the fund raising for EPUB Check  
… we will continue the development but we need to continue to bring in funds  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* epubcheck contribution form: [https://inclusivepublishing.org/epubcheckdonate/](https://inclusivepublishing.org/epubcheckdonate/)

**Junko Kamata:** About EPUB3 we found some message from EPUB Check  
… some duplicated elements as warning  
… elements, he or she shows message as @  
… it is not suitable for us  
… we offer EPUBCheck members  
… to reconsider about the message  
… want you to know about that  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** The deprecated elements you saw were around the image order?  

**Junko Kamata:** the @ focus  

**Garth Conboy:** displacement  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Please log issues in GitHub  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/issues](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/issues)

**Tzviya Siegman:** if you have other concerns, please bring those up  
… if you are uncomfortable logging issues, you can contact me or Romain Deltour  

**Junko Kamata:** Thank you, Tzviya  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** can you clarify the warnings for us  
… you have people in your market consider the book has failed because of this warning?  

> *Garth Conboy:* [https://github.com/w3c/publ-epub-revision/issues/1242](https://github.com/w3c/publ-epub-revision/issues/1242)

**Junko Kamata:** yes, that is right; huge impact for Japanese market  

**Garth Conboy:** I pasted in that issue on display sequence  
… Matt has proposed not deprecating that property value going forward  
… seems to be general agreement; needs to be taken up by CG  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Thanks, Garth for clarifying. We should note this is an issue for the Japanese market  
… and a good example of why we should be testing  

**Junko Kamata:** Thank you  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** any further EPUB Check discussions?  
… moving on  

### 3. Reader Expectations for Pop-up Content
{: #section3}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** while we have you, Junko, can you tell us how the Japanese market indicates pop-ups?  
… are you doing popped-up content for the books you are publishing?  

**Junko Kamata:** Actually I am not the person to see what happens  
… with the pop-up message  
… I believe Daihei knows more about that  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Popped-up content did not happen yet  
… for the children's books, there were some but limited  
… children and picture oriented books the market is limited  
… children publishers are not so interested in going into digital publishing market  
… might be something in educational publishing  
… but not so much popped-up content in trade publishing  
… My personal opinion is that popped-up content could really help compared to print  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** I have been working on use cases for a handful of places where we use popped-up for things like notes, footnotes, children's picture books for images and text to make them easier to see  
… for NA market  
… some widely used, some less used use cases to write up  
… answer keys on quizzes, flat kind of book pop-ups  
… we discovered all the PubBG chairs have been sick, so I have not yet finished that write-up  
… maybe end of this week  
… anyone else want to contribute to the Popped-up discussion?  

**Bill Kasdorf:** those sound like good use cases  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** On the next Asia/Japan friendly time call  
… I will reach out to the Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese and Chinese members to see if there are more use cases to report  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** That's great, thank you  
… we have also started to collect some ideas for future discussion topics  

> *Liisa McCloy-Kelley:* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kq5zOMzOxvHkM8yAgoqao0M0-z5FBzqtWWoO9qLS8PM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kq5zOMzOxvHkM8yAgoqao0M0-z5FBzqtWWoO9qLS8PM/edit#gid=0)

### 4. Topics for future PubBG calls
{: #section4}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** please feel free to add or comment to things there  
… and let us know about things that are of interest to you to discuss  
… possibly next discussion will be relevant to EPUB Check discussion  
… if still need to be validate; or if need to let go  
… any questions or discussion on that?  
… anything else anyone would like to talk about tonight/this morning?  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** have a lovely rest of your evening or day  
… we will convene again at one hour later in two weeks  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** thank you, Liisa  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** Feel better, Daihei
