> *Dave Cramer:* we still need a scribe

> *Murata Makoto:* Hi!

> *Luc Audrain:* Thanks Jeff

> *Luc Audrain:* we need scribing particularly on questions/answers after presentations

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Coffee break is very short because we have so much material to cover.  
… introducing Murai-sensei  

**Jun Murai-sensei:** Good morning everyone  
… re ing W3C Keio  
… also Host of TPAC meeting in Japan  
… welcome to Fukuoka  
… nice venue  
… G20 financial ministers also met here  
… their optical fiber is still here  
… talk about publishing  
… I am known as an Internet engineer  
… but also a UNIX engineer (originally) working on internationalization  
… much POSIX work is my work  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_Murai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_Murai)

**Jun Murai-sensei:** Japan cares about text and language  
… most of computer science design started in English  
… I accepted proposals in many languages  
… POSIX (UNIX OS) and Internet  
… RFC 822 said English ASCII only  
… but I said to accommodate other languages  
… History started by proposing change in standard for internationalization  
… accepting multiple languages  
… implementing diversity of languages  
… LONG history  
… Japan uses different languages and culture  
… we contribute to internationalization, accessibility, and diversity  
… in 94-96 W3C worked on Olympic/Paralympic  
… Olympic website  
… started Web Accessibility  
… Tokyo Olympics in 2020  
… Florian and Elika will explain to the AC this afternoon  
… Vertical writing progress  
… demonstrates diversity  
… not only for Japan  

**Florian Rivoal:** CSS Writing Modes progress  
… from the CSS WG  
… reaching the level of W3C Proposed Recommendation  
… on its way to the W3C Director  
… will get AC review  
… this powers Vertical text in Japanese  
… many others did the work  
… bugs have been fixed  
… after AC review it will be a formal W3C Recommendation  
… complete at the spec level  
… Japan has been major driver  
… more work to do  
… thanks to the broad Japan team  

**Jun Murai-sensei:** I appreciate efforts  
… and your (Florian) efforts)  
… also in publishing  
… important  
… users on internet is almost everyone  
… big change in 30 years  
… our contribution goes to everyone  
… publishing work for everyone  
… really appreciate your efforts  
… Thank you  
… enjoy Fukuoka  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Good work in CSS  
… thanks to Jun Murai  
… thanks to APA for their support  
… also Kodansha, Shueisha  

**Luc Audrain:** Thanks to APL  
… I hand it to Dave Cramer (Hachette) for the EPUB update  

**Dave Cramer:** I co-chair EPUB CG with Rachel Comerford  
… working on EPUB since 2001  
… in 2017 IDPF merged into W3C, starting the publishing work in W3C  
… 2 big problems  
… noone was using EPUB 3.1  
… no support from EPUBCheck  
… The CG wants to make things better  
… so we looked at these problems  
… preserve EPUB 3 content  
… Makoto-san and Garth Convoy (Google) recommended that we take 3.1, but make it backwards compatible with 3.01 - widely used in the world  
… so Matt Garish and I rewrote the spec  
… what to keep from 3.1  
… what to roll back for compatibility  
… bug fix  
… The CG was open to all interested parties  
… anyone in the world  
… not only members  
… 61 people participated  
… a community effort  
… In May we published EPUB 3.2 as a W3C CG spec  
… approved by Publishing BG  
… EPUB check needed to support EPUB 3.2  
… formal validation required by retailers  
… EPUBcheck had been dormant - relied on volunteers  
… but we ran out of volunteers  
… Rachel, Luc, on behalf of W3C wrote an RFP to fund the work  
… Much money raised  
… Daisy funded to actually revise EPUBcheck  
… released in April; same time we finished EPUB 3.2  
… Avneesh here from Daisy  
… great accomplishment of whole community  
… work together to find problems, do the work, get feedback, achieve the results  
… What is different about EPUB 3.2?  
… strict backward compatibility (with EPUB 3.0.1)  
… but core web platform (e.g. CSS) is evolving  
… instead of writing profiles, we are pointing to HTML spec, CSS snapshot  
… widely available components  
… so EPUB has evolved with the underlying technologies  
… Web Fonts external to package, WOFF 2.0  
… What does this mean?  
… If you are creating EPUB 2, you need to move to EPUB 3  
… accessibility benefits  
… If you are using EPUB 3, you don't need to change anything  
… please use EPUB check  
… use progressive enhancement  
… If you can't use EPUB 3, come talk to us  
… we want to fix that.  
… Thank you  

**Luc Audrain:** Thank you Dave  
… slides will be available  
… skip to Romain Deltour

**Romain Deltour:** Brief update on EPUB check  
… what's done, what's next  
… I work for Daisy  
… mandated to take over development and maintenance of EPUB check, by the BG  
… we needed to make up for 2 years lost time  
… dealt with pending issues and bug fixes  
… most important was implementation of EPUB 3.2.  
… synchronized release  
… January to April was testing phase  
… released in April; ready for spec  
… A community effort  
… many comments, feature requests  
… discussions in CG  
… Japanese publishing community noticed a new rule  
… created errors for Japanese content  
… pushed issue to CG  
… made "error" into "warning"  
… here are main objectives  
… foundational work to make more maintainable and reliable  

> *Avneesh Singh:* congratulations Romain for driving EPUBCheck to its current state!

**Romain Deltour:** improved system for GH issue tracker  
… revamping test suites (>1000 tests)  
… more readable  
… Next: carry on cleaning and refactoring  
… API interface  
… simplify for 3rd party tools and workflows  
… clean up 10 years of work  
… then add new checks  
… text and audio  
… not historically done by EPUB check  
… public website for project  
… landing page  
… download the latest  
… Thanks  

**Luc Audrain:** Introduce Takami-san from Kadokawa

**Shinya Takami:** I am Shinya Takami  
… two questions  
… EPUB 3.2 and EPUB check; situation in Japan  
… second is future requirements  
… existing epub files had errors due to a TOC violation  

> *Romain Deltour:* the EPUBCheck issue mentioned by Takami-san: [https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/issues/1036](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/issues/1036)

**Shinya Takami:** we requested a change to the behavior of epubcheck and the publishing groups cooperated  
… we do need to say that the Japanese epub files are wrong and there are many many wrong epub files in Japan  

> *Yu-Wei Chang (Yanni):* This TOC issues happened in Taiwan, too. Thanks for the EPUBCheck community.

**Shinya Takami:** in 4.2.2 this issue is now marked as a warning instead of an error  
… making this good for the Japanese market  
… the next question was a feature request for the future of epub3  
… order specifications of the nav doc; fallback spec of image elements in OPF (manga contents would be packaged more simply); Attribute spec of "linear=no" in OPF (capability extension for dynamic advertisement)  

**Luc Audrain:** PBG call for EPUBCheck fundraising  
… thank you to the companies that have donated to EPUBCheck  
… this is ongoing development  
… fixing existing bugs  
… updating to 3.2  
… and making it an easier to use tool for future generations  
… wear your tshirts with pride!

… link to EPUBCheck fundraising page:
[https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck_fundraising](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck_fundraising)

… we will switch now to the work of PWG  
… and future standards  
… I'd like to introduce Wendy Reid, co-chair of the PWG  

**Wendy Reid:** Thank you  
… today I'll speak about the audiobook specification  
… this work began 2 years ago  
… as a part of the conversations around publishing on the web  
… last year we formed a task force around the use cases about where they differ from ebooks  
… we focused on listening, portability, navigation, accessibility  
… when we talk about listening we talk about it consistently without interruption  
… potability means downloading, streaming, offline  
… .navigation means knowing where you are  
… and accessibility means enjoying content no matter ability  
… in the process of developing the spec we looked at 4 new use cases  
… they are supplemental content, table of contents, synchronized media, and packaging  
… supplemental content is content outside of the audio recording that creates a more full experience (ie images)  
… table of contents is rich html which gives people the ability to know where they are  
… synch media synchronizes audio and text or text and rich media for the purpose of accessibility  
… packaging would allow for simplified exchange for B2B  
… and user downloads  
… this summer we're reaching out to more stakeholders to find additional needs and use cases  
… and soon we will be moving to candidate recommendation and looking for implementors  
… questions?  
… the target date is the summer of 2020  

**Luc Audrain:** and now Laurent Le Meur from EDRLab  

**Laurent Le Meur:** Thank you  
… EDRLab is a consortium of publishers, accessibility organizations, technical orgs, etc  
… we are working on many things open source, including the Readium software  
… on accessibility, we are working on bringing more accessibility to reading tools  
… Readium is totally open source and a native toolkit for developers of reading applications  
… we want to support ebooks, comic books, manga, and audio books the same way  
… we want to support more than epubs  
… pdfs, wpubs, and anything else  
… we also want to mobile (ios, android)  
… and on the web  
… readium has a client and server part  
… which can be the same system or separate  
… this is how we can process epub files or web publications  
… we have dedicated some time to implement audio books on our platform  
… we can demo it from our platform outside of the presentation time  
… we are using the "readium web publication"  
… our own standard  
… we think it will be easy to create a W3C candidate recommendation from the readium standard  
… we would like to port to web publications as soon as next month  
… and are seeking a partnership  
… this would start with mobile/ios  
… and then be on desktop and the thorium reader  
… and then finally be support by readium web (online only)  

**Hiroshi Kawamura:** I'd like to show a presentation of an actual Japanese textbook  
… then present the situation of ebook accessibility in Japan  

> *Romain Deltour:* [demo, in japanese]

**Hiroshi Kawamura:** the narration is associated with the text hilighted on the screen  
… the narration here is normal speed, can be increased x3  
… or lowered to 80%, e.g. for learners of new languages  
… it also supports vertical writing  
… in Japanese-language textbooks, vertical writing (right-to-left) is a standard practice  
… we can also change the color combinations, for instance for low-vision users or dyslexic sudents  
… the idea is to adapt to the users' needs  
… the text font size can be adjusted  
… and the content reflows  
… someone said it's very difficult to narrate maths expressions [cue demo of maths content]  
… there are both a text description and an audio description  
… the EPUB Media Overlays allow us to associate human narration to the text  
… or the text can be read by TTS  
… this is a very important feature to support scientific content, relying on MathML  
… about Born Accessible Publishing in Japan  
… the overall legislation situation: ratification of the CRPD and the Marrakesh Treaty  
… they are in place in Japan  
… but what about actual content?  
… reasonable accommodation: there is always a solution to read, readily available solutions  
… now that we are hearing that EPUB 3.2 is ready, and EPUBCheck is available, and the ISO standard for EPUB Accessibility will soon be in place  
… I would like to point out that ~400 million USD are spent every year for public procurement of text books in Japan  
… accessibility of textbooks is a basic human right issue  
… it's a top runner of accessible publishing in Japan  
… conclusion: there are challenges, but policy development is the key  
… technical development is no longer a barrier  
… we need a change of attitude (copyright holders & publishers), fixing holes in the copyright law, and standardization of accessible and open affordable protection measures (like LCP)  
… thank you!  

> *Romain Deltour:* [up next: Avneesh Singh, DAISY Consortium]

**Avneesh Singh:** my presentation is about born accessible publications, what are the global regulations for accessibility, and are born accessible publications a reality?  
… my presentation is based on information from DAISY members  
… DAISY members are organizations around the world, committed to accessibility  
… mainly 2 bodies: UN Convention for People with Disability and Marrakesh treaty  
… in the US, section 508 applies both to web sites and publications  
… all the agencies must ensure that published content is accessible to people with disabilities  
… applies to publishers, but also to universities  
… they need to ensure their publications are born accessible, or provide alternative content  
… in Canada, there is the Accessible Canada Act (2019), and the government allocated 22 million CAD to help organizations and publishers to implement the regulation  
… in the UK, public sector bodies regulation (2018), say that web sites and mobile applications need to follow the WCAG principle (operable, understandable, perceivable, robust)  
… in the EU, the groundbreaking European Accessibility Act is in place (2019)  
… must be implemented in 2022  
… it not only requires publishers to release born accessible content, but the entire chain to provide accessible products (including e.g. reading systems, retailers, etc)  
… in Australia an inclusive publishing initiative was created  
… in the developing countries, Brazil has a regulation  
… if a print-disabled user requires a publication, the publisher must provide an accessible version  
… in India, People with Disabilities Act (2016), ebooks for everyday use must be following a universal design  
… specifically about EPUB 3, a community of experts for the government identified EPUB 3 as the recommended format  
… these are the views of the regulations. Are our efforts for Born Accessible giving the expected results?  
… in the US, born accessible is a reality in higher education  
… they are in fact competing around the accessibility features  
… in Italy, the LIA Foundazione is established with the publishing industry, over 24,000 titles are available  
… in Brazil, born accessible is a reality in K-12, more than 6,000 title are available in Braille  
… in the UK, it is a reality for simple publications like novels  
… in India, the government publishers have started providing textbooks in accessible EPUB 3  
… in Canada, funding is in place for born accessible to become a reality soon  
… in France, Hachette has taken the initiative for born accessible publishing, following the roadmap of the government  
… these are countries were it is working  
… EPUB 3 released in 2012 initialized this movement for Born Accessible publications; good progress over the past 7 years  
… it was thanks to a collective effort  
… I'm confident that in the next decade, we'll born accessible publications in many other parts of the World  
… thank you!

**Murata Makoto:** hi, I'm Makoto from Keio University  
… going to talk about standardization of EPUB Accessibility  
… it started in IDPF, then moved to W3C, and now we're trying to standardize it at ISO  
… the goal is to make it clear if the publication is friendly to visually impaired persons, dyslexic persons, and so forth  
… if we can properly identify which publications are accessible, readers can choose what they can read  
… for instance, last year a blind colleague of mind bought ebooks made of rasterized images, without knowing  
… what is the current status in ISO?  
… we're working on a Draft International Standard  
… we just finished the comment disposition  
… we just need one more ballot  
… the goal is to have an International Standard  
… a Draft International Standard is somewhat in between CR and PR for W3C  
… the ballot requires 6 months, then 2 months of comments. We're hopeful we'll have an International Standards in approx 9 months.  
… we received a number of interesting comments from Japanese publishers and content providers  
… one such comment was about external vs. embedded metadata  
… some prefer embedded metadata as it cannot be detached from the publication, some say that external metadata is better as it is easier to maintain  
… we think both approaches are feasible  
… we're investigating this in the EPUB 3 CG  
… Kawamura-san presented a diagram with highlighted text and synchronized audio  
… this is a difficult use case, and shows limitations of SVG and CSS  
… Prof Murai required an extension of SVG, we can also count on Florian's input  
… we're working on solutions  
… thank you!  

**Jun’Ichi Yoshii:** publishing is not just books; magazine ... are in scope, we can expand content  
… in the world of publishers, we need to take attention on who created content and for whom.  
… in the future we'd like to demonstrate what web publishing can do  
… important to have know who publishes info because it's ok in this case to publish stories about Loch Ness etc.  
… such info carried by NYT would be a problem.  
… there are maybe lots of techno that can be adapted for our needs. This is why we participate to the W3C.  
… important for us to maintain what we have built as publishers, also important to look at new markets and technologies. Provide a service that can bring joy to users, and be a trusted publisher. For that superb technology needed.  
… I encourage publishers to be more interested in new technologies. The print media industry should be more connected to other domains to transform our industry  
… in the past the print publishing industry made a product, no way to transform is later. Changes are already happening in other medias (news, magazines), it it the trend of the industry.  

> *Laurent Le Meur:* this perspective is important.

**Jun’Ichi Yoshii:** thanks.  

> *Laurent Le Meur:* next presenter, Shin Mizushima, Kadokawa

**Shin Mizushima:** I'm the responsible for product management division. raw material, printing, ebook also.  
… next generation is there via paper + digital content.  
… kadokawa has catched up with trends, 30 to 40.000 books transforms to ebook form.  
… 4.000 new books per year, ebook put immediately on the market also.  
… we way package many times, packages are important.  
… the user chooses btw paper or ebook; he chooses the package.  
… before users has to choose btw Vinyl and CD (2 packages), now digital distribution (new package)  
… many input received for speakers already.  
… there are some limitations; some contents can only be expressed in ebook, other in paper only.  
… a publishing company must find new values and present that to the readership.  
… the business has to be sustained for quite a long time.  
… therefore we have to balance production cost and selling price.  
… most present people come from IT sector. The cost structure is specific in the publishing sector.  
… viable business -> the product must be offered at a reasonable price -> reduce cost of reading material -> build huge inventory.  
… if we're selling physical, printing & transport is a cost. Not true in digital form.  
… we first produce the paper book then transform to ebook -> lots of work.  
… to convert books to disability friendly ebooks is difficult.  
… it's an issue of processing technology.  
… we need to progress on the processing technology.  
… as a publisher we must continue to make efforts for better methods and techno. We already sell book and ebook at the same time.  
… both forms have advantages. ebooks -> many in the same device; but without battery, no reading. publishers will continue producing both.  
… but the readership will not increase.  
… I'm an exception: when I buy a book I buy it in 2 forms, paper and digital.  
… thanks.  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** next presenter is Tatsuya Igarashi, from Sony Corp, chair of w3c media entertainment IG  

**Tatsuya Igarashi:** there are similarities btw digital publishing and media entertainment.  
… delivery; both are networked media, thanks to the raise of internet  
… more print media is going online; we see a shift from download to streaming.  
… in media entertainment at least; it may hit publishing also.  
… in the past there was a need for dedicated devices for media and publications, now shift to mobile devices.  
… we also see a move from mono-media (text, audio or video) to rich media (interactive, immersive). Even with a bluray.  
… w3c is now working on new techno, expression of media is evolving, this will change the way entertainment is delivered.  
… let's study common aspects of business  
… open standards will make possible to deliver content to different users, they free us from older industry standards.  
… more content is enjoyed through browsers, thanks to w3c technologies.  
… many IT giants are starting services similar to publishers' services.  
… thanks to their dominance of advanced technologies  
… the limited number of giants, with their delivery platforms, makes so that publishers must build on techno also.  

> *Laurent Le Meur:* Ex. Disney goes directly to consumers, with new platforms.

**Tatsuya Igarashi:** thanks  

**Luc Audrain:** last speaker is Florian Rivoal  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Florian is involved in the CSS process, also consultant for japanese publishers.

**Florian Rivoal:** EPUB 3.2 and EPUBCheck are great achievement, now what?  
… epub concentrates on the document. When the spec say "the document must be like" we need a document validator.  
… on the web is was the same not long ago. the html4 spec was like epub3 -> how the doc must be.  
… the web has changed, now the spec style is focusing on the software.  
… in html5 we don't use a document validator, we test the browser.  
… when we updated EPUBCheck we discovered that some content previously sold was in error.  
… if we focus on the software, we can know if the user can read the content, which is more useful.  
… s/was/were  
… if we want to use epub for the long term, we'll have better interop if we focus on what the software needs to do rather than what the content needs to be.  
… after EPUB (not after EPUB 3.2)?  
… epub is separate from the web because the browser does not read it natively.  
… the web is the convergent point of many industries  
… but the web must learn from publishing, it is not good enough for presenting books and magazines.  
… when we work on web publications, we don't improve the web.  
… therefore we don't really need a Publishing WG, but we need publishing people in all sorts of groups.  
… CSS writing mode was pushed by the publishing industry. Most web (browser) engineers are from the west but with common work with experts from the east we can achieve that.  
… by participating to groups about typography, packaging, media, accessibility we'll make the web better.  
… thanks  

**Jun Murai-sensei:** do you think browsers may replace reading systems?  

**Florian Rivoal:** DVD player became VoD applications, and now VoD services are in browsers.  

**Murata Makoto:** in the past I was tempted to create a variation of CSS for intl, experts of the W3C said "we'll deal with it". It was a success.  

**Wendy Reid:** we should be more involved in CSS etc. However I also think there is a place for the Publishing WG.  
… we are not that far away from the browsers, we can move a little bit closer.  

**Florian Rivoal:** my take is that the publishing people must be careful discussing with other folks.
