### 3. recent ISO discussions relative to EPUB
{: #section3}

**Leonard Rosenthol:** moving EPUB forward in Lisbon last week  
… standardization of EPUB 3.0.1 and LCP  
… on EPUB, 3.0 a TS, TS have a short life 3 years  

> *Murata Makoto:* No, it can be extended.

**Leonard Rosenthol:** published 2014, as in 2017 the document to be updated as an IS  

> *Murata Makoto:* No, I do not think so.

**Leonard Rosenthol:** something needs to happen, the update has to be an IS  
… in the meeting,  
… decision of the committee was to move 3.0.1 with editorial  

**Murata Makoto:**: JWG7 believed that EPUB 3.0.1 cannot be fast-tracked since 3.0 is already a set of Technical Specifications. Thus, they decided to use the normal procedure for standardizing EPUB 3.0.1.  However, the normal procedure requires rewrite based on ISO/IEC Directives, Part  2.
… The SC34 secretariat and I were surprised because we believe that 3.0.1 can be fast-tracked.  For example, ODF 1.2 was PAS-submitted although ODF 1.0 was already a set of International Standard.  Note that the ballot procedure for PAS and fast-track are almost identical.   The SC34 Secretariat, the JWG7 convenor, and I will discuss.

**Murata Makoto:** will be discussed with the secretaries  

**Murata Makoto:** 3.0.1 to be published as an IS should not be a problem  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** LCP not enough countries to accept the ballot  
… only Japan and Korea  
… US rep said a conceptually good idea, but concerns, Germany also  

**Murata Makoto:** 5 countries said yes but only 2 gave experts  
… we need 3 more countries members on SC34 with expert  
… Italy is in SC34  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** where to continue this discussion? It is _not_ in the scope of this group (or W3C)  

> *Murata Makoto:* Outside the scope of this group

**Luc Audrain:** ISO TF  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** LCP isn’t coming through W3C  

**Luc Audrain:** call through EDRLab  

> *Murata Makoto:* Agreed.

> *Leonard Rosenthol:* +1 for external coordination and notifications...

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** let this group know?  

**Luc Audrain:** mainly focused on EDRLab, I will contact Laurent with Makoto CC'ed  

### 4. EPUB 3 FXL for Children’s Picture Books
{: #section4}

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** challenging customers to use that standard, best practices  

**Garth Conboy:** is it fully conformant with 3.0.1  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** distributed with small changes  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1 to standards

> *Murata Makoto:* Yes!

> *Julian Calderazi:* Me too Liisa, would be interesting to take a look to it.

**Leslie Hulse:** best practice through BISG?  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** within the W3C CG  

**Dave Cramer:** the CG is working on best practices for EPUB  

**Murata Makoto:** list of existing best practices?  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** we found a way to code these children books that work well, we want to share this as best practices  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* so, "best practice" = "this is the practice we've found to work best right now"?

**Garth Conboy:** sounds good  

**Dahei:** share the info in Japan as well  

> *Ric Wright:* Readium would be very interested in seeing these "best practices" as they work in Readium 1/2/NG

**Dave Cramer:** sounds like the dream when we wrote the FXL specs, wonderful accomplishment  

**Liisa McCloy-Kelley:** if we publish BP within the CG, BillK would use coordination TF to make it known
